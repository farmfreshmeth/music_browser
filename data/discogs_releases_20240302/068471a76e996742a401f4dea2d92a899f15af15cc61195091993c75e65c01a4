assigned a work out. The workouts are as followed:\r\nC1: Warm Up\r\nC2: Arms\r\nC3: Waist\r\nD1: Abdomen\r\nD2: Legs & Hips\r\nD3: Buttocks\r\nD4: Cool Down\r\nIllustrations of the work outs are printed inside the gatefold of the cover.\r\n\r\nBack cover reads:\r\n\"The whole philosophy behind this album is a holistic approach to physical and mental well-being. From the up-tempo 'Stomp' by the Brothers Johnson, to Boz Scaggs' soothing 'Harbor Lights', there's much music here to provide a variety of dance and exercise experiences to fill not only physical, but also emotional needs.\r\nThe music forms the basis for a series of carefully structured exercises (from beginner thru advanced) which utilize each part of your body in specific sequence.\r\nWhether you're 15 or 50, with the help of this album and a little hard work, you can achieve a well-proportioned healthy body - not to mention the outward glow that comes from feeling good inside.\r\nSo be in harmony with your age. Learn to understand and respect your body. It's your temple. And remember, discipline is liberation!\"\r\n\r\nThe Jacksons, REO Speedwagon and Billy Ocean appear through the courtesy of Epic Records.\r\nThe Brothers Johnson appear through the courtesy of A&M Records, Inc.\r\nLinda Clifford appears through the courtesy of Gold Coast Entertainment, Inc.\r\nJimmy Buffett appears through the courtesy of MCA Records, Inc.","released_formatted":"1982","identifiers":[{"type":"Barcode","value":"0 7464-38054-1","description":"Text"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"AL 38055","description":"Side A Label"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"BL 38055","description":"Side B Label"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"AL 38056","description":"Side C Label"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"BL 38056","description":"Side D Label"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"PAL-38055-1AC ︵︵〰 P","description":"Side A Etched"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"P BL 38055-1BB","description":"Side B Stamped"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"PAL-38056-1AC P","description":"Side C Etched"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"PBL-38056-1BD P","description":"Side D Etched"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"P AL 38055-1H","description":"Side A, stamped, variant"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"P BL 38055-1BB","description":"Side B, stamped, variant"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"P AL 38056-1G","description":"Side C, stamped, variant"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"P BL 38056-1 m","description":"Side D, stamped/etched, variant"},{"type":"Matrix / Runout","value":"MASTERED AT ALLEN ZENTZ L.A., CALIF.","description":"Side A & C Stamped"},{"type":"Rights Society","value":"ASCAP"},{"type":"Rights Society","value":"BMI"},{"type":"Pressing Plant ID","value":"P"}],"videos":[{"uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrKZNqIR2U0","title":"The Jacksons - Can You Feel It","description":"Watch the official music video for Can You Feel It by The Jacksons​ \nListen to The Jacksons: https://TheJacksons.lnk.to/listenYD​\n\nSubscribe to the official Jacksons YouTube channel: https://TheJacksons.lnk.to/listenYC/youtube​\n\nWatch more videos ","duration":578,"embed":true},{"uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvUXkIqWOM","title":"REO Speedwagon - In Your Letter","description":"Music video by REO Speedwagon performing In Your Letter.
